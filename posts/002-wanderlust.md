For an optimist, not knowing what will happen next is the most exciting and wonderful feeling. “I just might record a #1 hit with my Indie Rock Revival Accordion String Band”. Then it takes courage to separate what could happen next from what is likely to happen next. Doing so means admitting “No, I probably won’t become a Rock Star bigger than The Beatles, and even worse, I’m probably not even going to win the lottery.” This realization might turn an optimist into a pessimist. 

However, we mustn't let trifles stand in our way, and we certainly do not wish to be pessimists! So let us make accordion music not because we want fame or recognition, but because by doing so we find and share joy. Ah ha! Not feeling so pessimistic anymore! 

...but I liked that feeling of wondering what will happen next, fantasizing about the good and fearing the bad. Now that I think about it, letting my mind wander through the possibilities inspired me to prepare for the hard times as much as it excited me for the good times. Excellent. I will continue to wonder optimistically about the future. My curiosity will inspire the motivation to find and love the good times and to weather the bad. I may bicycle across Alaska! I may share my wonder with my friends and family through art and music. I may adopt or father children and send this wonder to the next generation. I may wonder wonderful things as long as I live, for best of all: I may always wonder what will happen when I die. Brilliant! Optimism restored!

Wondering is exciting, and one of my favorite ways of wondering is wandering. In the city or the wilderness, I never know what is around the next corner. When I find out, there is always another corner not far ahead.

Inspired by my love for wandering, I am developing an iPhone game about exploration. The development process was wondrous itself: I started with only the minimalist (but open source) MOAI Mobile Framework, so I had to code nearly everything myself. I also made difficult decisions about structuring the code base (I am more familiar with the full featured game framework, Unity 3D, where most complex organizational decisions are already made). I am especially proud of the 2D lighting and shadows engine I coded in C++.
