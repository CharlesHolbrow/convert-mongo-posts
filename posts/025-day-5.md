For as long as I can remember, I've had a hard time falling asleep, and been a very light sleeper. I found that working very hard during the day can help me fall asleep at night, but if I'm thinking about the work when I try to fall asleep, it can lead to a very restless night. I think that the *avoiding laptop at night* strategy can help me get my mind off work, and generally improve my sleeping. Last night (Sunday) I had my laptop at the house. I hoped to get some work done in the evening, but I decided to not to it in favor of playing some music with my girlfriend. Then I had a night of very difficult restless sleep. Could this have been mitigated by not having my laptop at all - removing the possibility of working more?
