I have been paying attention to all the things in my life that seem to cause stress, or seem to reduce it. A lot of the stressful things really just boil down to not having enough time - I sign up or want to do more things than I can, and then all of them are just stressful because I'm worrying about getting everything else done. Is it best to just do as little as possible? There are so many interesting things to do, I think it's best to strike a balance, but where?
