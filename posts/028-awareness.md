In Fall 2014, I took the MIT Media Lab class [Principles of Awareness](http://aware.media.mit.edu/details), taught by the Media Lab Director Jio Ito, and Venerable Tenzin Priyadarshi.

Part of this class involved blogging about the topics. I started the blog here, and later picked up at the [class blog](http://aware.media.mit.edu).

On the conclusion of the class, I wrote this poem about my experiences. 

##Emperor Moth##

Sometimes when I lie awake at night  
trying to fall asleep  
The cares of a waking human badger my thoughts  
I think to myself:   
"I am an emperor moth"  
  
And I am the moth  
for a moment lightly fluttering  
through the evening breeze  
the full moon on my wings  
reflected in the forest river far below  
And I am human again  
  
lying awake and night  
a forgotten obligation  
Hounded by the cares of a waking human  
I think to myself:  
"I am a gray wolf"  
  
Far below the moth  
I am standing on a hill  
I am hungry for my next meal  
I am beside my brothers and sisters  
To the wolf, thoughts and feelings are the same  
An unfulfilled promise has slipped into my mind  
and I am human again  
  
The wolf cannot make a promise  
but lives for family relations  
And the moth never tries to be a moth  
only flies toward the light  
  
But I can make or even break a promise  
and I can live for my family and my pack  
and try to be the moth  
 And I can fly toward the light  
  
Somewhere between my own restless mind  
and the cardinal thoughts of the wolf  
I am flying toward the light
