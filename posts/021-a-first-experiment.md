Last night I left the Lab around 8pm, leaving my laptop at the Lab. As I've experienced before, I got just over 7 hours of sleep. Also, I talked on the phone with my Father for 30 minutes in the evening while I walked around exploring my new neighborhood. I definitely would have spent those 30 minutes on my laptop if I could have.
