Darth Fader was completed in a 24 hour period for Music Hack Day Boston in 2012 at MIT.

A Microsoft Kinect Measures your 3-D movements with a "Lightsaber", and modulates the playback of a music video using [Paulstretch](http://hypermammut.sourceforge.net/paulstretch/) for the audio and playback rate for the video. It overlays your silhouette onto the video.

The challenge was keeping the audio and video synchronized even though they are being manipulated with very different algorithms. 

In the video, I am performing Darth Vader with Ellie Goulding's music video for her song "Lights."
