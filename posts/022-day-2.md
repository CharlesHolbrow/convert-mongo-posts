Another 0 laptop night last night. I like to think that having the night to re-charge will give me more focussed productive hours during the next day. Yesterday (after a 0 laptop night) I had probably two very productive hours, and quite a few more hours where I was juggling lots of important things, but not getting a huge amount done.

I use my cell phone as an alarm clock. This morning after I turned my alarm clock off, I was very tempted to open up Gmail, and instantly read email from the last night. I would like to avoid checking email before I get out of bed. I will consider three strategies: 

- Go to bed early, and depend on being able to wake up naturally
- Avoid the urge by using a dedicated alarm clock. 
- Suppress the urge

Suppression causes a little stress in itself, and it is essentially the same as strategy as leaving my laptop at home.

I think it is best to take opportunities to easily avoid causing stress - but to consider the consequences, and be ready to spend the energy required to suppress if needed.
