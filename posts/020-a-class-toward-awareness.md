title: A Class Toward Awareness
tags: [awareness]
---

Today in [class](http://aware.media.mit.edu/details), Joi talked about *the many paths toward awareness*. 

Tenzin pointed out that there are many different types of awareness - awareness of one's feelings, one's perception of others, one's role in the community, and many more. 

The many paths leading to many different types of awareness suggests an exponential number of paths. For now, I'm going to focus on one specific path to mindfulness and wellbeing that has become very important to me over the last year. 

I'm looking for ways that I can use technology while mitigating its stress inducing qualities. By extension, I hope to  find ways to exist in a competitive high-stress environment like MIT while also practicing healthy wellbeing and mindfulness. A further extension, I hope find practices that will enable me to foster healthy well being in communities that recognize me as a leader.

The simplest path toward mitigating technology stress is to avoid technology. When I leave the Media Lab for the evening, and leave my laptop behind, I consistently get more than 7 hours of sleep. When I bring my laptop home, I consistently get less than 7 hours.

Today in class, Joi said *Anyone can be [aware] in a Monastery. The real challenge is being aware in a war*.

Leaving my laptop at the lab is like going to the monastery. For now, it is the path I will seek. When I decide it is important to bring my laptop home for the night, I will explore other paths. I am excited to find where they go.
