title: Day 3
tags: [awareness]

Today is the end of the first week of class. My goal is to find ways of using technology that mitigate the stress inducing qualities. For example, waking up and immediately jumping into email definitely does not help my well-being. 

Last night was friday night, and I stayed at the lab until about 9pm, bringing my laptop with me at the end of the day. I spent the evening with my girlfriend, and I didn't use the laptop at all (or feel the need to) so I don't think that there was anything negative about bringing my laptop home.

The ultimate goal is to be able to exist in the world of technology without it being a force for isolation, removing me from the real world. While avoiding technology is an easy way to avoid its negative impact, I'd like to *find* the best ways to use it.

I still think that it's a good idea to avoid technology intentionally.  Going back to Joi's comment about awareness during a war -- it may be good to be able to be well during a war, but it's still best to avoid wars. Similarly, it's best to avoid technology when possible. Unlike war, I like technology - the analogy breaks down, and it's up to us to find the best path forward.
